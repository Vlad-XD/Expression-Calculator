        I was inspired to create this small project after having an "aha!"
        moment during my programming languages class. For some time I have tried
        to figure out in my head how I would program an expression calculator
        where an expression is input, and if it is valid, the calculator
        produces the correct result. When learning about the recursive descent
        parser and working on a homework assignment related to it, I recognized
        how this approach could be utilized by a calculator program to parse an
        input and could be modified as necessary to calculate a result. Below I
        describe the grammar I utilized to create my recursive parser (which was
        partially inspired by an assignment provided by my professor).
        Additionally, below will be a link to my repository to see my final
        implementation.
